# MYSQL_BANK
This project focuses on analyzing a Bank Transactions dataset using MySQL. 
It demonstrates practical SQL skills including data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and analytical queries used in real-world banking data analysis. 
The dataset contains information about customer transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and balances over time.
